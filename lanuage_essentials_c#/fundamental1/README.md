# Fundamental concepts of c#

* Create a Loop that prints all values from 1-255
 * Create a new loop that prints all values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both
 * Modify the previous loop to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5
